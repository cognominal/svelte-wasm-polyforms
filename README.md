This is the beginning of a tool dealing with
polyforms using sveltekit.
It currently only show the twelve pentaminos.
Some cleaning is needed. Some leftovers from a previous
non svelte version.

Next step. Dragging, flipping and rotating pentominos
into a rectangle. For people to manually solve
the 3x20, 4x15, 5x12, 6x10 tiling problems.
